Notes
The googletrans library relies on Google Translateâ€™s API, which might face rate limits or interruptions. For production use or large-scale projects, consider using a paid API or an alternative service.
Future Enhancements
Add support for more language pairs.
Improve error handling for network issues or API rate limiting.
Add additional features like text-to-speech, or language auto-detection.
